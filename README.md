Malware Detection using Artificial Intelligence

# Data Preprocessing
Identified and dropped a row with a missing value in the "MajorLinkerVersion" variable from the training dataset.
Conducted univariate analysis on both dependent and independent variables, revealing unbalanced classes in the target variable and skewness in numerical features.
Observed imbalanced distributions in categorical features.
Detected outliers through bivariate analysis and removed them using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
Assessed collinearity and multicollinearity among features and eliminated highly correlated variables.

# Data Preparation
Performed preprocessing techniques including normalization, one-hot encoding, and categorical encoding to prepare the data for training.
Employed upsampling to address the imbalance in the dataset.

# Model Development
Evaluated various machine learning algorithms and found XGBoost to outperform others in terms of F1 score.
Fine-tuned the XGBoost model to optimize the F1 score.

# Conclusion
This summary outlines the steps taken to ensure the robustness and effectiveness of the predictive model developed. For further details or inquiries, please refer to the code and documentation provided.
