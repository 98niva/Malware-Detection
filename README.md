Malware Detection using Artificial Intelligence

The raw data here was obtained from Kaggle- the malware security partner of Meraz'18 - Annual Techno Cultural festival of IIT Bhilai, the said raw data constituted malware and legitimate files- https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-detection/data.

Malware represents software which is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain authorised access to a computer system. Legitimate files are software that don't behave like malware and are useful and harmless to the users.

Statistical analysis was done on these files which mainly constituted the extraction of PE information and calculation of entropy of different sections of these files.

# Data Preprocessing
Identified and dropped a row with a missing value in the "MajorLinkerVersion" variable from the training dataset.
Conducted univariate analysis on both dependent and independent variables, revealing unbalanced classes in the target variable and skewness in numerical features.
Observed imbalanced distributions in categorical features.
Detected outliers through bivariate analysis and removed them using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
Assessed collinearity and multicollinearity among features and eliminated highly correlated variables.

# Data Preparation
Performed preprocessing techniques including normalization, one-hot encoding, and categorical encoding to prepare the data for training.
Employed upsampling to address the imbalance in the dataset.

# Model Development
Evaluated various machine learning algorithms and found XGBoost to outperform others in terms of F1 score.
Fine-tuned the XGBoost model to optimize the F1 score.

# Conclusion
This summary outlines the steps taken to ensure the robustness and effectiveness of the predictive model developed. For further details or inquiries, please refer to the code and documentation provided.
